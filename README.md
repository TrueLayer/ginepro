# Overview

`ginepro` enriches [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) by periodcally updating the list of
servers that are available through a `ServiceDiscovery` interface that currently is implemented for DNS.

## How to install

Add `ginepro` to your dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
ginepro = "0.3.0"
```

## Getting started

The interface remains fairly the same as we implement all the logic for a drop-in replacement for
tonic's `Channel`.

```rust
// Using the `LoadBalancedChannel`.
use ginepro::LoadBalancedChannel;
use ginepro::pb::tester_client::TesterClient;

// Build a load-balanced channel given a service name and a port.
let load_balanced_channel = LoadBalancedChannel::builder(
    ("my_hostname", 5000)
  )
  .channel()
  .await
  .expect("failed to construct LoadBalancedChannel");

// Initialise a new gRPC client for the `Test` service
// using the load-balanced channel as transport
let grpc_client = TesterClient::new(load_balanced_channel);
```
